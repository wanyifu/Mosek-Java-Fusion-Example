Mosek-Java-Fusion-Example
=========================

This program solves the following problem ( Credit to Midterm 2, Spring 2013, CS 170 by Prof.Rao for good taste of story)

2. Itâ€™s peacetime. Mulan wishes to manufacture rocket fireworks, or snake fireworks. She needs 1 unit of
black gunpowder and 2 units white gunpowder for a rocket firework and 2 units of black gunpowder and
2 unit of white gunpowder for a snake firework. She makes $ 3 for each rocket and $ 4 for each snake.
And has 150 units of black gunpowder and 200 units of white gunpowder. She determines that she should
make 50 rocket fireworks, and 50 snake fireworks. Either find a better way for Mulan to choose what to
manufacture or prove that she has done the best possible thing. (Hint: she is making 350 dollars.)
